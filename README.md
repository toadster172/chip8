This is a simple Chip-8 emulator written in C.
The only build requirements are SDL and a c compiler.
To build for Unix and Unix-like, simply use `make`.
To build for Windows, use `make chip8.exe`. Compilation for Windows requires mingw.
#### Todo
* Add command line options for graphics
* Implement Super Chip 8 compatibility
* Work on better implementation of SDL
