This is a simple Chip-8 emulator written in C.
The only build requirements are SDL and a c compiler.
To build, simply type make and the makefile should automatically compile the program.
#### Todo
* Rewrite code in opcode.c and chip8.c to be readable
* Implement sound support and opcode 0xFX0A
* Increase compatibility with certain games that don't work
* Add command line options for graphics and frequency
* Implement Super Chip 48 compatibility
